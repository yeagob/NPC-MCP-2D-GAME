# Grid System 2D - Implementation Status

## âœ… COMPLETED FEATURES

### Core Grid Operations
- [x] Screen point to grid cell conversion with mouse click support
- [x] World point to grid cell conversion
- [x] Grid cell to world position (center) conversion  
- [x] Linear index â†” row/column conversions
- [x] Multiple object positioning within single cell (1-4 objects)
- [x] Configurable grid offset (left, top) from object position
- [x] 8-directional navigation with boundary checking

### Visualization System
- [x] Gizmo-based grid visualization in editor
- [x] Configurable grid line colors
- [x] Optional cell number display
- [x] Cell highlighting for debugging
- [x] Grid bounds calculation

### Advanced Operations
- [x] Radius-based cell search (Manhattan distance)
- [x] Rectangular area selection
- [x] Line drawing between cells (Bresenham algorithm)
- [x] Distance calculations (Manhattan, Euclidean, Chebyshev)
- [x] Adjacency detection (diagonal, orthogonal)
- [x] Direction calculation between cells
- [x] Border and corner cell identification

### Debug & Testing
- [x] Comprehensive debug component with context menus
- [x] Visual debugging with colored gizmos
- [x] Practical game example with player movement
- [x] Unit test ready architecture

### Architecture Quality
- [x] SOLID principles implementation
- [x] Zero hardcoded values - centralized configuration
- [x] Extension method pattern for modularity
- [x] POCO structures for data transfer
- [x] Safe optional results pattern (GridResult<T>)
- [x] Self-documenting code without comments

## ðŸš€ READY FOR PRODUCTION

The Grid System 2D is **production-ready** with:
- Complete core functionality
- Advanced utilities
- Comprehensive testing tools
- Clean, extensible architecture
- Zero external dependencies

## ðŸ“– USAGE

1. Add `GridSystem` component to GameObject in scene
2. Configure grid dimensions and offsets in Inspector  
3. Use public methods for all grid operations
4. Optional: Add `GridSystemDebug` for testing and visualization

The system provides a solid foundation for any 2D grid-based game mechanics.
